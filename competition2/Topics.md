+ [Default of Credit Card Clients](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients)

In this project, you are going to predict if a credit card client is going to make a [default payment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_(finance)) using a set of demographic and financial information of the client. This is a classification project (although __regression models__ can be used in it).
